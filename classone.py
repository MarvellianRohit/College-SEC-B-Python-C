# Assign value 20 to variable A
A = 20
# Assign value 10 to variable B
B = 10
# Calculate the sum of A and B and store it in variable Sum
Sum = (A + B)
# Calculate the subtraction of B from A and store it in variable Sub
Sub = (A - B)
# Calculate the multiplication of A and B and store it in variable Mul
Mul = (A * B)
