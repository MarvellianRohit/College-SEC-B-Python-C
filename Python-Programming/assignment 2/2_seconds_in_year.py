# Q2: Write a python program that calculate and prints the number of seconds in a year.

days_in_year = 365
hours_in_day = 24
minutes_in_hour = 60
seconds_in_minute = 60

total_seconds = days_in_year * hours_in_day * minutes_in_hour * seconds_in_minute

print("Number of seconds in a year (assuming 365 days):", total_seconds)
